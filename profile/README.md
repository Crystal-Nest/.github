# Crystal Nest

## Who we are

We are three italian developers, Riccardo, Alberto, and Mauro, making up a small group mainly focused on creating and maintaining many Minecraft mods across a wide range of versions.  
Everything started with one of us creating a mod for a private server, and after a couple of years, the others joined. Together, we could improve everything about our projects, from ideas and methodology to speed and quantity.  
However, as we are all studying at university and have jobs, your support is what allows us to dedicate more time to all of this!

## Our work

We have an ever-expanding catalogue of mods, and for each actively maintained mod, we always support it from the current Minecraft version to the 3 minor versions below (e.g. `1.21`, `1.20.x`, `1.19.x`), but not necessarily all patch versions are going to be supported (e.g. `1.20.4` and `1.20.2`, but not `1.20.1` and `1.20`).

In early 2024, we surpassed the huge milestone of 10 million downloads on CurseForge and now aim higher than ever!  
We have many ideas for new mods, and we can't wait to make them all come true.  
We also plan on expanding our community with different ways to engage with it.

## Useful resources

We currently have our own website, which can be found [here](https://crystalnest.it), albeit it's still a work in progress.  
Nonetheless, for fellow mod developers, the website already offers the option to download an up-to-date customizable template for a multiloader mod!  

Some of our mods come with a wiki accessible from the respective mod's GitHub page.

Further down, you'll find a comprehensive list of platforms where our projects are available. All pertinent information about our projects and ways to support us can be found there!
